# TRL-Portfolio-Management (In Progress)

## Introduction

This repository contains an PyTorch implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to Financial Portfolio Management. It is motivated by [**A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Financial Portfolio Management Problem**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10059) by Jiang et. al. 2017. It is additionally motivated by a similar TensorFlow implementation which can be found [**here**](https://github.com/deepcrypto/Reinforcement-learning-in-portfolio-management-)

In this work we implement two deep reinforcement learning algorithms, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to allocate portions of a fund to different financial products with the goal of maximising returns. Additionally we aim to investigate the use of Transformers for the neutral network structures.
